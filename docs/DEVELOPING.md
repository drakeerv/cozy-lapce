To quickly identify and navigate to the source code behind a UI element, use the built-in UI inspector.

1. **Press `F11`** to open Inspector mode;
2. **Click** on the UI element you're interested in;
3. **Use the ↑/↓ arrow keys** to move up or down the node hierarchy to locate the exact UI node;
4. **Right-click** the selected node, it will auto copy the name of node ;
5. **Search** for that name in your editor’s global search panel to locate the corresponding code.

> 🧠 Tip: Nodes with a meaningful `name` are usually the best entry point for code navigation.
